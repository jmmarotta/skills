# AGENTS.md

This repository is a lightweight collection of agent skills and helper scripts.
There is no formal build system; most work is editing Markdown or running a
small set of Python utilities in `skills/skill-creator/scripts/`.

## Commands (Build/Lint/Test)

### Baseline assumptions
- Python 3 is available on PATH (`python3`).
- No package manager config is present (no `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.).
- There is no repo-wide lint or test runner configured.

### Validation (closest thing to tests)
- Validate a single skill directory:
  - `python3 skills/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py <path/to/skill>`
  - Example: `python3 skills/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py skills/frontend-design`
- Use this as the “single test” command for skill files.

### Packaging
- Package a skill to a `.skill` zip:
  - `python3 skills/skill-creator/scripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill> [output-dir]`
  - Example: `python3 skills/skill-creator/scripts/package_skill.py skills/code-review ./dist`

### Initialize a new skill
- Create a new skill template:
  - `python3 skills/skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <path>`
  - Example: `python3 skills/skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.py my-new-skill --path skills/`

### Linting
- No linter is configured. Do not invent commands.
- If linting is needed, ask for preferred tool (e.g., `ruff`, `flake8`, `black`).

### Test suites
- No test runner is configured.
- Use `quick_validate.py` to sanity-check a specific skill.

## Repository Structure

### Top-level
- `README.md` describes the skill collection.
- `skills/` contains individual skills and utilities.

### Skill folders
- Each skill is a directory with at least a `SKILL.md`.
- Optional subfolders: `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`.

### Skill creator utilities
- `skills/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py` validates `SKILL.md` frontmatter.
- `skills/skill-creator/scripts/package_skill.py` packages a skill to `.skill`.
- `skills/skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.py` generates a new skill template.

## Code Style Guidelines

### General
- Prefer minimal, direct changes. Avoid refactors unless requested.
- Keep scripts small and explicit; avoid over-abstraction.
- Use clear, intention-revealing names over cleverness.

### Python version and runtime
- Target Python 3 (scripts use `#!/usr/bin/env python3`).
- Use standard library modules where possible.

### Imports
- Standard library imports first, then third-party, then local.
- One import per line.
- Prefer `from pathlib import Path` over `os.path`.
- Avoid unused imports.

Example ordering:
```python
import sys
import zipfile
from pathlib import Path

import yaml

from quick_validate import validate_skill
```

### Formatting
- Use 4-space indentation.
- Keep line length reasonable (~100 chars); wrap long strings if needed.
- Use blank lines between top-level functions.
- Use docstrings for modules and public functions.

### Naming conventions
- Functions and variables: `snake_case`.
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- Classes (if introduced): `PascalCase`.
- Skill identifiers: `hyphen-case` (lowercase letters, digits, hyphens).

### Paths and files
- Use `Path` for filesystem work.
- Avoid string concatenation for paths; use `/` operator.
- Always resolve user-provided paths with `Path(...).resolve()`.

### Error handling
- Prefer early returns with clear user-facing messages.
- Use `try/except` around filesystem operations.
- Return `None` or `False` to signal failure; avoid raising new exceptions
  unless required.

### CLI behavior
- Provide usage help on incorrect arguments.
- Exit with non-zero status on failure.
- Use concise, user-readable output.

### Strings and output
- Prefer f-strings for interpolation.
- Keep messages short; include context (file path, skill name).

### Data validation
- Validate required fields early.
- Keep validation rules simple and explicit.
- Do not silently coerce invalid values.

## Markdown Style (SKILL.md files)

### Frontmatter
- Must start with `---` and include YAML frontmatter.
- Required keys: `name`, `description`.
- Allowed keys: `name`, `description`, `license`, `allowed-tools`, `metadata`.

### Naming rules for `name`
- Must be `hyphen-case`.
- No leading/trailing hyphen or consecutive `--`.
- Max length 64 characters.

### Description rules
- Must be plain text; no angle brackets.
- Max length 1024 characters.

### Sections
- Use clear, task-oriented headings.
- Provide concrete examples when relevant.

## Tooling notes for agents

### What to edit
- Most changes are in `SKILL.md` files and related references.
- Keep edits localized to the skill you are working on.

### What not to do
- Do not invent lint/test commands.
- Do not add new files unless required.
- Do not add new dependencies without approval.
